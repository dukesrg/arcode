V1.01
Based on the Action Replay DS Code Types

Use ar2bin to convert a cheat code into a cht file. By default, arcode.bin will load arcode.cht from the root.

Should work on All Old 3DS FW 9.X versions except anything higher then 9.5.0-22.
Run with http://bit.ly/1LgLvSG (http://dukesrg.no-ip.org/3ds/rop/?LoadCode.dat&arcode.bin)

Limitations
Code only executes once. So no freezing values, or enable/disable with button combos while in-game.
Non of the code hacks work.

Offsets are based on the FCRAM dump offsets. ARCode will automatically add 0x14000000 to them.
